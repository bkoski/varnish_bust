Klarlack is a ruby client library for the varnish administration interface.

Please note: You need at least version 2.0.3 of varnish for purging to work.

=== Installation

  sudo gem install schoefmax-klarlack --source=http://gems.github.com

=== Example

Lets purge all blog posts from the cache...

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'klarlack'

  varnish = Varnish::Client.new '127.0.0.1:6082'
  # the regexp is not a ruby regexp, just a plain string varnishd understands
  varnish.purge :url, "^/posts/.*"

In a Rails app, you might want to use use this in a cache sweeper.

=== Specs

  spec spec

=== TODO

* Support authentication when varnishd is started with <tt>-S</tt>
